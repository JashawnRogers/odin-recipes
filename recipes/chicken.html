    <p>Sticky, easy honey-garlic chicken made simple, with the most amazing 5-ingredient honey-garlic sauce that is so good you'll want it on everything! Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta, or a salad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garilc powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>

        <li>Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sear until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain most of the excess grease from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons behind.
        </li>

        <li>Arrange chicken thighs skin-side down in the pan. Place crushed garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add honey, water, vinegar, and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until sauce reduces down and thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
